This is a very simple script that I wanted to release, because I couldn't find any free script of this kind without vulnerabilities or optimization stuff. The whole script is in server side which means that there are **no posibble exploits** – e.g. setting any job you want or skipping the cooldown timer.

Simple switchjob script for roleplay purposes.\
Players can switch between **two** different jobs with command (_`/switchjob` by default_).

## Features
